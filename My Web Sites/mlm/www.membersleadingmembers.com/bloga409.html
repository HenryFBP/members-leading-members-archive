<p class="">Alice Nowicki</p><p class=""><strong>School District 130</strong></p><hr /><p class="">For three years now, our members have suffered from the out-of-state trustees’ inability to provide effective leadership in contract negotiations, representation, and political engagement. They took away your membership meetings and cheated In last year’s election, denying you the right to select your leadership!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>Now is the time to have your voices heard!</h2><h2>Vote for Members Leading Members!</h2><h2>Ballots are mailed on <strong>October 16th</strong>!<br></h2><p class=""><em>If you don’t receive a ballot by </em><strong><em>October 23rd</em></strong><em> , please call </em><strong><em>1-888-317-1906</em></strong><em> and ask for a replacement ballot!</em></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>Here is our promise to our members.</h2><h2>Please read our four-point-plan below.</h2><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Members Leading Members Slate is predominantly comprised of rank and file members, who are or once were Union Stewards and Union leaders at their respective work sites and have joined together to fight to save our Local.</p><p class="">Collectively, we have many years of experience organizing, empowering and representing members. This leadership team has firsthand knowledge on what many of our members’ needs are and if elected we intend on addressing those needs.</p><p class="">Our 4 point plan outlines how we intend to restore transparency, collective bargaining power, respect, and most importantly member involvement and pride in their Union.</p><p class="">In order to restore Local 73 to legitimacy and set a new standard of effectiveness, members need a team with a plan.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><h1>Negotiate strong collective bargaining agreements.</h1><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Our members deserve the best and brightest contract negotiators working for them to protect gains they have worked so hard for, and negotiate stronger future contracts with the best wage increases and benefits possible. When we are elected, it is our plan to train Local 73 staff, hire new staff where needed, and fully support staff in these duties by providing them with Local 73 resources.</p></li></ul></li><li><h1>Effective unit representation.</h1><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">We’ll take the necessary steps to ensure that members are represented properly, from the beginning of the grievance process up to and including arbitration. We will put the full force of the Union legal team to work for you. We will hold representatives and organizers accountable to return members phone calls within 24 hours.</p></li></ul></li><li><h1>Internal and external organizing.</h1><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>External Organizing:</strong> externally, we should be working every day to organize the unorganized. It is essential to our continued strength and power as a strong Union to grow. Because, if we are not growing we are slowly dying. This is what we believe is currently happening, their is no urgency to grow our Union and the Members Leading Members Officers will not continue this practice which is deteriorating our strength by neglecting this most important aspect of our Union. Union Leaders will go to bat for groups and individuals vulnerable to management manipulation, working tirelessly to organize these workers.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Internal Organizing</strong>: internally, we’ll work to ensure member awareness about Janus, a Supreme Court case that has made Fair Share dues collection illegal and drastically weakened the power of unions in fighting for workers’ rights, pension and benefits. What does Janus mean? Some workers in your work site will not be required to pay Union dues and the members who do pay Union dues will be carrying workers who do not pay any dues but receive the same benefits as those members who paid to be Unionized. It is one of the most damaging U.S. Supreme Court decisions that exists against worker strength. We’ll leverage all of the power of Local 73 to ensure members are educated and organized to confront this critical Supreme Court decision. It is imperative that we engage and mobilize our members to take action against this and other threats to workers. We will train and work with member leaders and stewards to build power at each and every work site. Under the direction of the leadership each Division will be responsible for:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Developing a communication plan and network so that all members have information available to them and know what is going on in their Union. This plan will include membership meetings, modern technology (Twitter, Instagram, etc.), work site specific literature, regular work site visits and more.</p></li><li><p class="">Engaging, developing and training members and member leaders to build strength at their work sites.</p></li><li><p class="">Build in accountability measures so staff understand that members are the most valuable resource the Union has and the importance of respecting them.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><h1>Political Engagement and Community Involvement.</h1><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Our union is predominately city, county, municipal, and state workers. Therefore, we will engage in rigorous political advocacy at every level in order to educate our members about campaigns that are labor friendly. This means having a political director and a lobbyist to advocate on behalf of our members full-time both in the Chicago land area and downstate.</p></li><li><p class="">We’ll be actively involved in community advocacy efforts, leveraging the voice of the Local to be a positive force for a range of causes. Committees will be developed for members who are interested in these causes which include: Fighting for immigration rights, support for Black Lives Matter, and our continued fights for women and LGBTQ+ rights. Although this is an extensive list of battles, our members will have our utmost support in taking care of their needs and priorities.</p></li></ul></li></ol>]]></description></item><item><title>Elections are still coming up for Local 73 starting on October 16th!</title><dc:creator>Henry Post</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:14:17 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.membersleadingmembers.com/blog/2019/9/25/the-us-department-of-labor-forces-local-73-to-re-run-election-due-to-dian-palmers-slate-cheating-sep-26</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a330eb8b1ffb6e54c3f0cff:5c12fd86b8a045c20077166e:5d8c37643e73ce4ee31d6339</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Dear Member,</p><p class="">By now you should have received by mail a document titled “<strong>OFFICER NOMINATION AND ELECTION NOTICE” from SEIU Local 73</strong>.</p><p class="">You have received this document because the election is being re-run by the U.S. Department of Labor due to the illegal actions by Dian Palmer’s slate in the 2018 election.

As members leave, the union becomes less effective for everyone else.</p><p class="">Local 73 members have given Dian Palmer a chance for three years and she has failed them by lying, cheating, and self-dealing.</p><p class="">Most members will put up with a lot, because they understand the big challenges faced by unions, but members draw the line at their leadership lying and cheating. Dian Palmer has lost the trust of the membership of Local 73. To date, Palmer has taken no responsibility as a leader for her former executive board member that cheated in last year’s officer election.</p><p class="">This is your opportunity to show Dian Palmer that you will not be disrespected and that you demand better from your union leaders.</p><p class=""><strong>Members Leading Members</strong> is a reform slate made up of members just like you, fighting for strong contracts, powerful organizing, vigorous member representation, and an aggressive political program. You have the chance to stand up for the union you deserve. You have another opportunity this October 16th, 2019 to vote for Leaders who you trust and will fight for you.</p>

Our promise to the members is that we will fight very hard to negotiate the best contracts possible and represent you against your employer.</p><p class="">Our slate fought hard to give you elections and a choice. We have fought hard to save your union and knew that Dian Palmer's slate cheated on the election, only to win by 370 votes.

<p class=""><em>SEIU Local 73 leadership changed the by-laws so that its members will never be able to hold them accountable again in a membership meeting. </em></p><p class="">There were many changes in the new constitution and bylaws, such as banning Local 73 staff from running for office, but the most damaging change came when the trustees eliminated all four annual membership meetings required by the old constitution. This act alone will completely take the members’ rights away when it comes to holding their leaders accountable and charting the direction of their local. Dian Palmer, from the very first day she came in from Wisconsin as a trustee, hated the membership meetings and the fact that the members were asking questions.</p><p class="">In the last membership meeting, February 23rd, 2019, Dian Palmer was asked multiple times by members why they are eliminating the membership meetings, only to answer with,</p><p class=""><br><br><br></p><blockquote><h2>“I will get back to you at the next meeting with an answer.”</h2></blockquote><p class=""><br><br><br></p><p class="">Let’s hold Diane Palmer responsible and demand an answer at the next membership meeting, April 27th, 2019!</p><p class="">Almost every question was suppressed with the same dismissive response, as if Dian Palmer did not know why she changed the by-laws regarding membership meetings. She knows why she changed the by-laws; she was ordered by her boss, Mary Kay Henry, to do so. Mary Kay Henry personally brought Dian Palmer to Chicago from Wisconsin and gave her the opportunity, staff, and means to run Local 73, expecting full loyalty only to herself, and not to the members. So, when the boss calls and wants you to eliminate Democracy for the members to make life easier for her, you must obey.  As a result, the members lost their membership meetings forever as well as their voices.</p><p class="">Here are some other benefits of the membership meetings that will be gone forever:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Members can no longer vote on their quarterly union budget/financial accountability.</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Members can no longer vote on dues increases.</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Members can no longer vote on any mergers with other unions.</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Members can no longer vote on bylaw changes.</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Members can no longer question their union leaders and call a motion to conduct business charting the direction of their own union.</strong></p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Members can no longer come to membership meetings and exchange information with other members in order to educate themselves on what is going on in their union.</strong></p></li></ul><p class="">Losing all of these rights is losing your voice as a member to participate in the direction of your union. All of these rights are now deferred to the executive board only. Due to membership demands, and the fact that the members have not attended a membership meeting in over a year, Dian Palmer decided to hold a membership meeting April 27, 2019, at 10AM. Let’s show up and tell her exactly how you feel about your loss of democratic rights to govern your local!<br>&nbsp;<br>I urge all the members of Local 73 to participate and let Dian Palmer know that she has taken away their voices by eliminating the membership meetings. Let the current leadership of Local 73, who don’t want to be held accountable by the members, know that you will vote them out the very next chance you get!</p><hr /><h1>On&nbsp;Saturday, April 27th, 2019, show up for <span><strong>the last SEIU Local 73&nbsp;Membership Meeting at:</strong></span></h1><h1><strong>10:00 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.&nbsp;<br>300 S. Ashland Ave. Basement&nbsp;<br>Chicago, IL &nbsp;60607</strong></h1><hr /><h1>Local 73 members file charges against Dian Palmer for violating bylaws</h1><p class="">Dian Palmer wasted no time after the election, giving herself a salary of $166,000 per year. In her haste, she forgot to read her own bylaw changes and their requirements. Although Palmer can increase her staff salaries, which she did, her own salary is set and approved by the executive board. A closed-session hearing was held on this issue at the Local 73 Executive Board meeting on April 13th.</p><p class="">Results of that hearing have not yet been released publicly to the members, including those individuals that filed the charges. There is no doubt that this was another sham hearing and they most likely exonerated Dian Palmer of all wrongdoing, because that is the agenda of SEIU officials. They never hold their leaders responsible. Either way, the members need a written response of the results of this internal hearing released immediately.</p>

<h1>Members’ Dues Wasted!</h1><p class=""><a href="https://twitter.com/iosbakerjoe">Joe Iosbaker</a>, a self-proclaimed revolutionist and a member of Local 73, has accepted a $7,500 donation from Dian Palmer for an organization called “CAARPR“, the <a href="http://naarpr.org/">Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression</a>. This would normally not mean anything other than a waste of money that our members worked so hard for. However, Joe has gone out of his way to support Dian Palmer and the International Union, and has even lobbied members to vote for them in the last election!</p><p class="">Joe Iosbaker was also in the committee for the Future, which took away all members’ rights, including membership meetings and the right for Local 73 Union staff to run for elected office.</p><p class="">Later, in October 2019, Joe Iosbaker was conveniently appointed as the election chair overseeing the first ever Local 73 elections, making sure Dian Palmer got elected.</p><p class="">This is the same Joe Iosbaker that praised Sal Rosselli in California for standing up to the International Union, a decade ago. Joe obviously has changed his mind since then and sold out his members in return for money from SEIU Local 73. He knows full well that the International Union and the current SEIU Local 73 leadership do not have the best interest of the members in mind, but will ignore everything around him for a measly donation for his organizations. Joe has proven he is willing to compromise his beliefs in exchange for money. No member of Local 73 should trust anything that Joe has to say, because he has been bought and sold by the International Union and Local 73 officials.</p><h1>Legal Update </h1><p class="">As we reported in our previous issues, the International Union was supposed to investigate the election appeal within 90 days of filing. Members of Local 73 have filed a charge with the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor has now conducted a thorough investigation and the case has gone to Washington, D.C. for disposition.</p><p class="">The Director of the Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. will issue a final decision on the election violations by May 31st, 2019. Should the Director find any violations of labor law or constitutional bylaws, he has the power to order a new election to be held within 60 days of its finding. We are confident that the Department of Labor will overturn this election and order a new, fair election conducted by them, and give the members true democracy and voting rights.</p><h2>Judge Pallmeyer issues a decision on the bylaw changes</h2><p class="">As many of you have heard, in June 2018, the out-of-town trustees systematically changed the Local 73 bylaws in order to gain an advantage in the election by removing the right of all Local 73 staff, representatives, and organizers to run for office.</p><p class="">Judge Pallmeyer issued a decision in which she defers the bylaw question to the Department of Labor, stating that she has no jurisdiction over internal bylaw changes and that the original motion that was filed by the members of Local 73 was to hold elections and that goal has been accomplished. </p><h1>Political Endorsements: Even MORE Members’ money wasted!</h1>

<p>As many of you know, the trustees changed the bylaws last May and had the rubber-stamp committee of the future approve them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Within the next two weeks, they shoved these bylaw changes down the membership’s throats by illegal voting in direct violation of the constitution and bylaws of Local 73 and the international.</p><p>There were many changes in the new constitution and bylaws, such as banning Local 73 staff from running for office, but the most damaging change came when the trustees eliminated all four annual membership meetings required by the old constitution.

I was the only staff person to state that that is a direct violation of members’ rights and would be an illegal act, violating the constitution and bylaws. Finally, she relented, but was not happy to be questioned and held accountable by the membership. After she terminated ten senior representatives, Dian Palmer, with the help of the international union attorneys, finally came up with a plan to eliminate the membership meetings altogether and replaced them with one annual delegates meeting. By doing this, the members do not get a chance to vote in the following issues concerning their union:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Members can no longer vote on their quarterly union budget/financial accountability.</p></li><li><p>Members can no longer vote on dues increases.</p></li><li><p>Members can no longer vote on any mergers with other unions.</p></li><li><p>Members can no longer vote on bylaw changes.</p></li><li><p>Members can no longer question their union leaders and call a motion to conduct business charting the direction of their own union.</p></li><li><p>Members can no longer come to membership meetings and exchange information with other members in order to educate themselves on what is going on in their union.</p></li></ol><p>Losing all of these rights is losing your voice as a member to participate in the direction of your union.

Ashland Ave. Basement&nbsp;<br>Chicago, IL &nbsp;60607</strong></p><h1>Legal Update </h1><p>As we reported in our last issue, the International Union was supposed to investigate the election appeal within 90 days of filing, but to date the International Union has not responded with an answer or held a hearing whatsoever. As 90 days have passed, members of Local 73 have filed a charge with the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor will now conduct a full and thorough investigation over the next 30 days. Should the Department of Labor find any violations of labor law or constitutional bylaws, they have the power to order a new election to be held within 60 days of its finding. We are confident that the department of labor will overturn this election and order a new, fair election conducted by them, and give the members true democracy and voting rights.   </p><h1>Local 73 members file charges against Dian Palmer for violating bylaws</h1><p>Dian Palmer wasted no time after the election, giving herself a salary of $166,000 per year. In her haste, she forgot to read her own bylaw changes and their requirements. Although Palmer can increase her staff salaries, which she did, her own salary is set and approved by the executive board. The charges filed by the members are given to the secretary of treasurer Joe Richert and a hearing by the executive board will follow within 30 days. Copies for ethics violation will be given to Dan Zapata, union attorney. Dian Palmer acts as if she’s above the law. These are the very bylaws that she dictated to Local 73 members, but she does not seem to want to follow them!</p><h1>The hypocrisy of SEIU union authoritarianism</h1><p>Historically speaking, the authoritarian playbook is always the same. Their ultimate goal is to consolidate power, and they always use the same time-tested techniques. First, they start by attacking the free press. This is just a way to weaken the media’s ability to hold a ruler accountable. You can see this dynamic in play when Trump calls any negative coverage of his administration “fake news” and threatens to take away the media’s credentials.</p><p>Next, they will usually try to blame the country’s problems on minorities or use other vulnerable populations as scapegoats. This gives the ruler a way to validate people’s concerns, while redirecting their anger towards a specific group. If people start protesting or revolting, they will blame the dissent on foreigners or paid protesters. This usually gives a ruler justification to use force against civilians or to strengthen police forces.</p><p>Next, they’ll try to weaken judicial checks on power. They usually do this by publicly discrediting judges or the judicial system, defunding departments that investigate internal criminal activity, and working to remove people from powerful positions that are not loyal to the regime or its ruler, which leads us to the value of loyalty. Authoritarians will always reward loyalty over competence because they fear a system that holds them to the same ethical and legal standard as everyone else. This is why you usually start to see very unqualified people running departments that they shouldn’t be running. Under an authoritarian system, their loyalty is more valuable that their knowledge or skill.</p>

<p>Under an authoritarian government, elections can and do happen, but they have no power to yield any type of social or political change, and often there is widespread election fraud and opposition is discouraged or eliminated by any means necessary.</p><p>There is no doubt that SEIU President Mary Kay Henry does not condone any authoritative leaders, especially not Trump.</p><p>Why then, is she running SEIU International in a way that so closely resembles the description of an authoritative regime?<br></p><h1>Facts:</h1><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>SEIU is widely known in the industry to demonize and silence individual staff that speak publicly, criticizing leadership and advocating on behalf of members.</p></li><li><p>SEIU threatens or terminates its employees if they are not loyal to the president or the International Union.</p></li><li><p>SEIU hires and promotes staff based on loyalty and not merit.</p></li><li><p>SEIU has drastically changed Local Union bylaws in order to maintain power and eliminate member involvement.</p></li></ul><p>The hypocrisy is apparent. Mary Kay Henry runs her union in an authoritative manner, at the same time, she points the finger at employers and government officials, shouting for more democracy! There is a reason why this is happening, and it all has to do with Mary Kay Henry padding her pockets. While she’s accusing other leaders of authoritarian practices, Mary Kay Henry keeps a close eye and controls every aspect of who is in a leadership role in every local around the country. She makes sure to support presidents like Dian Palmer who are loyal to her because that is an individual who will not question her wholly undemocratic leadership decisions. This is a true sign of an insecure leader that has poor leadership qualities and will resort to authoritarian rule in order to maintain power, very much like Donald Trump.</p><p>Mary Kay Henry rewards loyalty with big salaries, still paying consulting fees upwards of $120,000 to retired leaders such as Michael Fishman and Eliseo Medina. Even though these individuals receive $150,000 in pension contributions from SEIU, this is more money on top of their pension. This is why the International Union is so out of touch with the average member that barely makes $25,000 per year! They cannot relate because they don’t live in the same hemisphere. The very corporate model that they have criticized for years is what they’re using in their own organizations.</p><p>What’s ironic is that Mary Kay Henry is responsible for Trump winning the white house when she did an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton despite widespread disapproval from her own executive board. If Mary Kay Henry stayed neutral and let Bernie Sanders compete with Hillary, but the outcome would have been different and Bernie Sanders would have won, going on to beat Donald Trump, as the polls predicted.</p><p>Instead, Mary Kay Henry endorsed Hillary Clinton early and gave her hundreds of millions of dollars of political contributions, secured from the members’ money, tilting the scale for Hillary. These political contributions are exactly what Mary Kay Henry’s program is all about. She has abandoned negotiating strong contracts and representing members, instead Local Unions are ordered to double up on COPE contributions at any cost. This was evident when Local 73 was trusteed. Dian Palmer and Denise Poloyac were not interested in negotiating strong contracts for the members and representing workplace issues. Instead, they embarked on a six-month program to re-train the staff on how to collect more political money and send it to Mary Kay so that she can shower the democratic party candidates with your hard-earned money. Mary Kay Henry is out of touch with what the members’ needs are. It’s time for the members to wake up and vote these leaders out! It’s time for change!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p>

<p>You probably don’t even know who these people in Washington, D.C. are, but their leader is <strong>Mary K. Henry</strong>, and she’s making well over $250,000 per year with your dues money! She also has a staff of about 140 people, which are hand-picked cronies by her! And get this: You don’t even get to vote for her to be in office. The individuals that vote for her to be in office are her hand-picked executive board members from around the country. Dian Palmer is one of them! That’s why Mary K. Henry sent organizers and lawyers to Chicago to help Dian steal the Local 73 election, because she knows that Dian would return the favor come May 2019 when Mary K. Henry runs for her third term of presidency. This is NOT what democracy looks like. This is cronyism at its finest and is being perpetrated with your union dues money!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a local level, please read below how your dues money are spent by Local 73.</p><h2>Illegitimate Local 73 Leaders waste no time to pad their pockets</h2><p>Dian Palmer, Joe Richert, Jeff Howard, and Science Meles wasted no time whatsoever padding their pockets with new salary increases, courtesy of <strong>you paying your union dues!</strong></p><p>Members Leading Members will bring you exact numbers when the LM-2 reports come in, in 2019.</p><p>However, independent sources tell us:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Dian Palmer increased her salary to approx. $166,000, plus an international union stipend, worth approx. $12,000 per year.</p></li><li><p>Joe Richert went from approx. $95,000 per year to approx. $120,000 per year.</p></li><li><p>Jeff Howard earns approx. $110,000 per year.</p></li><li><p>Science Meles got the biggest increase, moving up from approx. $80,000 per year to approx. $110,000 per year.</p></li><li><p>They were not done yet! They also increased the salaries of various cronies inside the Local, such as Tyson Roan (General Counsel), Sean McGough (Organizing Director), and it appears, anyone else who exhibits blind loyalty to the trustees at the expense of the membership. Once again proving that if you are blindly loyal to the trustees and the International, you will get paid handsomely. However, if you challenge them with the best interest of the membership in mind, you may likely find yourself unjustly fired and demonized.</p></li></ul><h1>Legal Update</h1><h2>SEIU Local 73 Election Appeal</h2><p>Over <a href="https://www.membersleadingmembers.com/s/Officer-Election-Appeal.pdf"><strong><em>106 pages in appeal documents</em></strong></a> were submitted to the SEIU International Union November 13, 2018. The International Union SEIU has acknowledged that they have received the election appeal, but to date they have not responded with a hearing nor have they begun to investigate the election misconduct.</p><p>The SEIU constitution and bylaws calls for the International to internally investigate any alleged election misconduct internally, within thirty days of receiving our appeal, before we file a charge with the U. S. Department of Labor.</p><p>Most likely, the International is going to try to drag their feet. However, we have contacted the U.S. Department of Labor and they will intervene after 90 days from the first date we filed the appeal, which means if the International does not hold hearings by January 29th, 2019, we can file the charge with the Department Of Labor and they will investigate immediately. Given all the violations by Dian’s team, most likely the DOL will call for new elections within 60 days. This time the DOL with conduct the election, and not the hand picked yes-men like Joe Iosbaker who allowed them to cheat every chance they got! </p><h2>Illegal bylaw changes</h2><p>As many of you have heard, in June 2018, the out-of-town trustees systematically changed the Local 73 bylaws in order to gain an advantage in the election by removing the right of all Local 73 staff, representatives, and organizers to run for office.</p><p>A decision on the bylaw changes is pending before federal judge Rebecca Palmeyer. This means that if Palmeyer rules that the bylaws were changed illegally, then she can order a re-do of the election, but this time it will be conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor and not the cronies hand-picked by the trustees!</p><h2>Eight unjustly terminated representatives</h2><p>Last week, the discovery phase of our litigation contesting our terminations began.</p><p>As you recall, the terminated Local 73 representatives were some of the most experienced representatives Local 73 had, each with over thirty years of experience: Remzi Jaos, Brenda Woodall, Rick Loza, Willie English, Leonard Simpson, Tom Haley, Bashir Nuruddin, and Terri Barnett were mostly terminated in January for exercising their right to run for local union office.</p><p>The International Union and trustees have so little respect for their staff that they ignore legal and democratic rights so that they would not be challenged in the election. The hypocrisy of all of this is that union’s such as SEIU are supposed to protect the rights of all workers, and set the standard. Yet here the International Union and out-of-town trustees are violating workers’ rights because it suits the agenda of the International Union to take control at any cost. This is merely an underhanded way to try to get rid of anybody who has the best interests of the membership in mind, instead of blind loyalty to the International leadership.</p><p>The International also hurt the membership by taking away some of the most experienced negotiators Local 73 had, leaving a void in both contract negotiations and in representation. Members are calling the union for representation only to get inexperienced representatives who have not been trained and do not know how to properly represent the membership.</p><p>The new International rule that is implemented by the out-of-town elected trustees states that each representative will have over 3,000 members to represent. This is an impossible task, given the geographical area that needs to be covered by one person. Thus, members cannot and will not be properly represented with this new plan.</p><p>As of January 2018, Local 73 staff attorneys are handling a very small amount of arbitration cases, if any, dropping most of the responsibility to the Union representatives, who are not trained to represent members in arbitration! The philosophy of the International and current elected leadership is that you should process your own grievances and negotiate your own contracts in order to free Local 73 representatives to go out and solicit as much COPE money as possible.</p><p>In turn, this COPE money is used in various questionable<em> </em>ways to pad the pockets of politicians who don’t have your best interests in mind. For example, last month, SEIU Joint Council <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/labor-group-seiu-1-million-preckwinkle-mayoral-campaign-fund/"><span><em>gave Toni Preckwinkle $1,000,000 towards her mayoral campaign</em></span></a>, ignoring the complaints from 6,000 Cook County members that Toni Preckwinkle has subcontracted their work and eliminated positions, as well as holding back wages as long as she’s been Cook County President.</p><p>In her tenure as Cook County President, Toni Preckwinkle has decimated Oak Forest hospital, cutting down staff and turning the 1,000 acre facility into a ghost town, leaving a medical void for the community and cutting down Local 73 staff by the hundreds. SEIU ignores their members’ cries and backs Preckwinkle for mayor despite all the harm she has done to our members. Should she win, she will likely do the same thing to over 10,000 members that Local 73 has working with the city of Chicago.</p><h2>Local 73 still not doing their job!</h2><p>On numerous occasions, members have called the newly-elected representative and secretary treasurer, Joe Richert, on a termination hearings. However, he did not show up to represent the members, and they were terminated. City of Chicago workers and &nbsp;Chicago Park District workers are in a bitter fight for their contract, but the newly elected leaders (Dian Palmer, Jeff Howards, Science Meles) do not know how to negotiate contracts. Therefore, they have called in for help from New York and have brought in a negotiator to help finish the contracts. This type of issue was unheard of before the unlawful terminations of the eight Local 73 representatives by the trustees.</p><p>If the leadership of Local 73 does not know how to negotiate contracts, why are they receiving salaries?   How can they teach the rest of their new staff how to do their work and service the membership? The International Union does not care if you are served, just as long as you continue to pay your dues so they can elect and appoint people that are blindly loyal to them and their agenda to raise your COPE contributions for the International Union! </p><p>Members Leading Members will continue to  fight in federal court to get our jobs back with full back-pay for each and every experienced and dedicated Local 73 representative, in order to restore excellent representation to the whole membership!</p><h2>Announcements</h2><p><strong>Your union cancelled this year’s Christmas party due to lack of funds but </strong><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/labor-group-seiu-1-million-preckwinkle-mayoral-campaign-fund/" target="_blank"><strong><em>gave Toni Preckwinkle $1,000,000 to run for mayor</em></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Your union’s leaders have yet to announce a membership meeting in January 2019! The only official announcement to date is an executive board meeting January 12, 10AM to 2PM. By the way, you can attend this meeting if you wish as an observer. The last membership meeting was in February 2018! </strong></p><p>Be sure to call your union and ask <strong>when they are holding their next membership meeting</strong>, because they will most likely announce it three days before it happens, in order to have as few participants as possible!</p><p>Local 73’s number is <strong>(312) 787-5868</strong>.</p><p>It’s time to hold your union leaders accountable and know what your dues money is paying for! Call your union and demand better service and accountability!</p><p><a href="http://eepurl.com/dpdUVL"><span>Stay in contact and sign up</span></a>!
